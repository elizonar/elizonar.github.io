									<p><a href="https://www.miamistudent.net/article/2024/03/jon-stewart-return-the-daily-show-politics?ct=content_open&cv=cbox_latest"> Original article for <em>The Miami Student</em></a></p>
								<p>I love “The Daily Show,” America's only source for news, 
								the satirical platform for people to openly criticize political 
								leaders and world conflicts with humor and genuineness.</p>
								<p>I started watching the show when I was 15, during the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton election year in 2016. 
								Trevor Noah was the new host at this time, and I never understood the controversy about him being the new host — he was amazing.</p>
								<p>Now ,we're in a new era —  well, the same era in American politics — but in a different form.  
								Jon Stewart says it better when he introduces the presidential candidates as “these fucking guys.”<p>
								<p>I loved Stewart's perspective on the state of U.S. politics. Since we've experienced the Trump presidency and the Biden presidency in full,
								Stewart shares a newer critique of both candidates than Trevor Noah could back in 2016.</p>
								<p>Stewart's return to sitting behind a desk, telling his audience exactly what to think and do, hasn't been as well received as he hoped, 
								based on <a href="https://x.com/BatchLiberal/status/1757864855564910756?s=20">a post from Mary Trump</a> and other influential figures. He hosted the show from 1999–2015, 
								and decided to leave the show to spend more time with his family right before the 2016 election year.</p>
								<p>He mentioned during his second Monday hosting the show that people don't like his two-sided approach to our presidential election season,
								quoting some inflammatory X (formerly known as Twitter) posts. My favorite response from him: 
								“We know what they say, democracy dies in discussion.”</p>
								<p>Jon Stewart is exactly who we need for this upcoming election season.</p>
								<p>With several  global issues happening at once, and the volatile political climate, many people don’t have a way to discuss topics
								like the war in Ukraine or the Palestine-Israel conflict or why we have two of the oldest men running for the leader
								of the United States. Stewart's version of “The Daily Show” is the best outlet for these discussions.</p>
