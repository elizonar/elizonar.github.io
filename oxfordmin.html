								<p> I remember the first time I set foot in Oxford, on a campus tour of Miami University. I was a sophomore 
								in high school, the only one in the auditorium room full of juniors and seniors ready to move into the 
								next phase of their lives. </p>
								<p> I was too scared to raise my hand when they asked if there were any sophomores in the crowd,
								gripping my notepad tight. Then they played a video, which I wish I could find on Miami's YouTube channel,
								about how college is made up of 2 million minutes. </p>
								<p> My first thought: That number has to be wrong. My second thought: How would I know where I want to go to college yet? 
								I was only 16 years old. </p>
								<p> And yet here I am, 22 years old, about to graduate with two degrees and 2,103,840 minutes of memories at a university 
								two hours away from home and everything I knew. </p>
								<p> Over 150 visits to Western Dining Commons, Maple Street and Garden Commons
								to eat meals with people who would become close friends. </p>
